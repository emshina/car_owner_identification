First , the owner should register

A government Project

	It has four software connect together through a database named dat.

The first software is the registration system (registration.py).
	This is the first place where you have to register your car with the government like NTSA give all your details like number plate, name, phone number, id number and a picture of your car.
	All information is added here.

The second software is the police station system (police station.py):
	This is where the police station can get to know all the details about certain car which have done or committed certain crime.
	In police station, the police station has to type the number plate in the system and gets all details including the car owner phone numbers and so on.
	After getting the phone number, he has to text or calls the victim to report to a certain police station in a given time like 48 hours.
	If he reports within the given time then well and good the matter is dealt with.
	If he reports past the given time the police can go ahead and add charges to the victim.
	Let’s say he didn’t even show up. Well and good, here is where the third software comes into play.

The third software is insurance system…
	The victim goes to take car insurance cover. What happens, the person in charge of giving the insurance have to first  type the number plate in the system and gets to know if the person is eligible to get the insurance or not. If victim has some charges which he has done then he can’t get the insurance. The victim is first told to report to a certain police station first to clear his or her charges.
The fourth software is the car government system 
	In this the government can annually keep records of all people that have committed crimes  and have not cleared with police stations.

Fourth software is records(records.py)
The government can keep records annually of people who has committed crimes.

	Only a police station can add or remove charges on a victim.
	And only the police station that has added the charges can remove them.
	The insurance system can only see the charges but can’t remove them.
